MyCms
=====
Version 0.1-Alpha
Build 3

=====

MyCms is a content management system based on the Laravel framework.
The idea is simple. A CMS should be flexible, easy to navigate and extendable.

I'm stil working on the base Dashboard and Pages module, to create a nice backend experience. 

Documentation will come.
